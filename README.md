# Horiseon Website Code Refactor 

## Description

This project was to refactor existing code for the purpose of ensuring it is fully accessible to people with disabilites that are utilizing assistive technologies to view websites.  It is important to make websites accessible so that all people can view websites and it reaches a broader audience, as well as to avoid lawsuits for people that cannot view the site due to access issues.

I was able to accomplish this goal by utilizing semantic HTML tags.  Semantic tags help to describe the content to the browser as well as the developer.  When an assistive device is used to "read" the webpage the semantic tags will help in describing the webpage.  It was also paramount to add these semantic tags without changing the actual view of the website.
